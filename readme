Minesweeper Exercise
--------------------
This was supposed to be a thirty minute challenge.

The goal is to create an ASCII representation of a minesweeper board. On each run the mines will be randomly placed.
Each tile will either display a '*' to represent a mine, or it will display a number which represents how many tiles
it is touching that are holding a mine.

No defensive programming needed. Imagine the user will never pass in a bad value.
